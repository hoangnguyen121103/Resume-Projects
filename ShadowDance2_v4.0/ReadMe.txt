Overview:
This is a game that takes inspiration from Konami's "StepMania" game arcane. It includes 3 distinct level:
	+Level 1: Notes will descend from the top vertically in the 4 lanes. The player has to press the corresponding arrow key when the note overlaps with the stationary note symbol at the bottom. The accuracy of how close the note was to the stationary note when the key was pressed, will determine the points given.
	+Level 2: Same game-play as level 1 but the player now has to deal with additional features such as a special lane that has special notes(including: bomb notes (clear all notes on the screen in that lane if the key was pressed when it is near a stationary note), double-score notes, speed-change notes).
	+Level 3: Final level includes all features above as well as additional feature involving creatures such as enemies and a guardian. An enemy moves horizontally and it will steal notes from nearby lanes by colliding with them. The guardian will shoot projectiles at the nearest enemy when the corresponding key is pressed

How to Win:
All 3 levels needs to be cleared to win the game. Player needs to achieve the score of 150 to clear level 1, score of 400 to clear level 2 and 350 for level 3.

Note: The level1.csv, level2.csv and level3.csv can be modified. The format for those files is: Lane, Note Type, Frame at which that note should appeared.
