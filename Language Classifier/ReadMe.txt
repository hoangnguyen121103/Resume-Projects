Overview: 
This is a simple Language Classifier program utilising the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm. To facilitate its learning process, it requires a CSV file that lists various languages alongside samples of text in those respective languages. A document whose language is to be identified must be provided. This setup enables the program to effectively learn from the dataset and accurately determine the language of the provided document.
 
To use please follow these steps below: 
	• Create a CSV file in the format: “Language”,”Text in that language”(include the double 	quotation mark”). The file should be placed in TrainingFile in Files. This file will 		allow the Classifier to learn the language
	• Place your document in DocumentFile. 
	• Run the main function with path to the CSV file and the document file as input to the 	function.
